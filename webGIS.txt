1- get the data

Use the Copernicus browser / 
Open Access Hub (or the new Copernicus Data Space) to search by tile/AOI
date range and max cloud cover, then download the product (register/login required). 
Prefer L2A products when present.

2- confirm which files you have / product type
L2A normally comes with a Scene Classification Layer (SCL) and surface reflectance bands. 
L1C contains TOA JP2s. If you have JP2s convert to GeoTIFF (below) or if you already have .tif bands you can skip conversion

3- which bands and their native resolution

B03 (Green), B04 (Red) and B08 (NIR) are the 10 m bands you listed — ideal for NDVI / NDWI calculation and for mapping features at fine scale. (Other useful bands: B11/B12 SWIR are 20 m.)

4- (If needed) convert/align bands to a common GeoTIFF / grid

5- mask clouds & invalid pixels first

If using L2A: use the Scene Classification Layer (SCL) to remove clouds
cloud shadows, saturated/no-data pixels, snow, etc. 
SCL is produced by Sen2Cor and has ~12 classes (NO_DATA, SATURATED, CLOUD_SHADOW, VEGETATION, WATER, CLOUD_MEDIUM/HIGH, THIN_CIRRUS, SNOW, …). 
Use it to build a boolean valid-pixel mask

7- post-processing & classification

For water mapping use NDWI (Green, NIR): NDWI values > 0 (or >0.2/0.3 depending on local conditions) usually indicate water — tune threshold per site using validation points. 
Consider MNDWI (replace NIR with SWIR, e.g. B11) to reduce built-up confusion and better detect open water in urban/complex scenes. 
Sentinel Hub custom scripts

For vegetation use NDVI (NIR vs Red): high values (~0.6–1.0) → dense green vegetation; low/negative → non-vegetated. Calibrate thresholds locally.

Clean small speckles with morphological operations or majority filters; polygonize water/vegetation masks for mapping and integration with FRA boundaries.
