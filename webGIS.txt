1- get the data

Use the Copernicus browser / 
Open Access Hub (or the new Copernicus Data Space) to search by tile/AOI
date range and max cloud cover, then download the product (register/login required). 
Prefer L2A products when present.

2- confirm which files you have / product type
L2A normally comes with a Scene Classification Layer (SCL) and surface reflectance bands. 
L1C contains TOA JP2s. If you have JP2s convert to GeoTIFF (below) or if you already have .tif bands you can skip conversion

3) which bands and their native resolution

B03 (Green), B04 (Red) and B08 (NIR) are the 10 m bands you listed â€” ideal for NDVI / NDWI calculation and for mapping features at fine scale. (Other useful bands: B11/B12 SWIR are 20 m.)
